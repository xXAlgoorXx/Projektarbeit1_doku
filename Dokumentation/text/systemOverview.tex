\chapter{System Overview}

The goal of the system is to calssify panorama images into defined classes.
For that a CLIP like network is used on the edge.
As a computing platform a Raspberry Pi 5 with the hardware accelerator extension is used.
The hardware accelerato is the Hailo-8L entry level accelerator (\cref{fig:overview:aikit}).
The System which is used and developt in this work, can be divided in 2 parts.
One part is the compilation of a neural network on a PC.
The other part is the inference of a compiled network on the Raspberry Pi.

\section{Compilation of a Network}

During compilation, the network is quantized and simplified.
This reduces the amount of memory and processing power needed to use a network.
The network has to be compiled to format which can be executed on the hardware accelerator.

In this work the compilation is done with the \Acrlong{dfc} from Hailo.

\section{Inference on Raspberry Pi}

To use a network on a hardware accelerator a specific software has to be used.
Beacuse of the usage of the Hailo hardware accelerator a software from hailo is used in this work.
