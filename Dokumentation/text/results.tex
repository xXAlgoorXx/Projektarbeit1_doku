\chapter{Results}
In this chapter the results and their collection is discussed and interpreted.







\section{Execute models on the edge}
To have a success full compilation of a network it is important to understand which part of network dont lose much accurcy due to quantisation.
In \cref{methods:sec:cutlocation} the model had an incerase in accurcy after the matrix multiplication isnt calculate on the edge anymore

\section{Working with Hailo}

Hailo has proven to have a good product with the Hailo 8L hardware accelerator.
The combination with the Raspberry Pi 5 makes it easy to develop in comparison to other solutions found.
Although nearly all examples from hailo are focused on image processing.
The help is handeld through the hailo community.
This is beneficial if other people have the same problem.
But on serius problems like the problem with the dimension swap (see \cref{implementation:sec:translation}) it fellt like no one of the hailo people which are answering in the forum understood enough to tell that the compilation of this specific network isnt possible at the moment.
