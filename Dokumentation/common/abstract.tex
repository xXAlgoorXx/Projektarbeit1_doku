\chapter*{Abstract}

 Hexagon AB, a leader in digitization technology, focuses on integrating advanced scene understanding capabilities into edge devices for its scanning applications.
 This project evaluated the use of hardware accelerators, identifying Hailo's products as the most suitable due to their availability, power efficiency, and computational performance.
 By leveraging Hailo's M.2-enabled hardware integrated with Raspberry Pi, neural networks can execute efficiently on edge devices.

The study builds on previous work by Lia Winkler, who demonstrated that CLIP, a model for aligning text and images, is well-suited for scene classification tasks.
Her method involved dividing panoramic images into patches and classifying them via majority voting, achieving strong results. TinyCLIP, a lightweight version of CLIP, was also explored for its reduced parameter count and efficiency.
    
This work implemented CLIP and TinyCLIP on Hailo hardware using Hailo’s Dataflow Compiler (\acrfull{dfc}), which quantizes and compiles networks.
However, the \acrshort{dfc} does not support transformer architectures, necessitating adaptations. Text encodings were pre-calculated, and ResNet-based vision encoders were split between Hailo hardware and the Raspberry Pi CPU.
Despite initial accuracy loss after quantization, optimizations—such as refining quantization levels, adjusting encoder splits, and tuning thresholds—improved performance.
RN101, the widest tested network, achieved the best results, highlighting the importance of network width for quantization.
The findings underscore the potential of combining CLIP-based models and hardware accelerators for edge computing applications while revealing challenges in hardware constraints and model quantization.
