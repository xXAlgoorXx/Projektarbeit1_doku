\chapter{Literature research}

This Literature research studied relevant papers in the field of scene understanding.
State of the art is to use deep learning models for scene understanding tasks.
The goal of to discover the semantic information whthin a given scene, which is the base for many applicaitions such as surveillance, autonomous driving, traffic savety, vision-guided mobile navigation and many more.
The term gains a lot of relevantcy because of the rapid evolution of neural networks over the last couple years.
Most of the papers found online tackel the topic of autonomous driving\cite{sceneunderstandingautdriving1}.
In early research \acrfull{cnn}\cite{SegNet} were mostly used for this task.
With the introduction of the transformer \cite{attentionisallyouneed} many researchers moved on to this new arcitecture.
Soon multi-modal networks like CLIP\cite{clip} and ALIGN\cite{ALIGN} came up.
These networks use a text- and image-encoder to learn an predict relations between image and text pairs.
