\chapter{Introduction}
Hexagon AB\cite{hexagon} is a global player in digitisation technology and specializes in measurement and positioning systems.
Hexagon’s laser scanning devices produce point cloud data of the environment and capture images through additional cameras integrated into their scanners.
A challenge in Hexagon’s laser scanning applications is to build ever smarter scanning devices which have better understanding of the scenes they are placed in by preferably pre-processing the environment
information they record directly in the field.

The goal of this project is to work towards integration of enhanced scene understanding capabilities into the scanning application’s edge devices.
A scanner should, for example, be able to classify a scene on various hierarchical levels and with increasing level of detail, namely indoor vs. outdoor, construction site 
vs. completed building (eventually inferring even the degree of building completion), office complex vs.
family house, small vs. big room, kitchen vs. bathroom, bathroom with vs. without bathtub, etc.

To this end, this project aims at evaluation, implementation, and test of smaller machine learning models
suitable for an Edge AI platform to demonstrate that corresponding classification tasks
could be embedded on board of a laser scanner in the future.
