A part of this work is a market analysis of the available hardware accelerator with M.2 interferance.
The found accelerator are summerised in table.
Many of the available product are either to old and weak (Coral M.2 accelerator) or only available as preorder.
From the current lookt at products, Hailo seems as the most suited for this project.
It uses less power than products from Coral with higher TOPS.

For the future a hradware accelerator which has the capability to process floating point models looks very intressting.
But the advantage from floating point to intger has to be proven.

There are also many suppliers which produce accelerator chips.
It is possible to design a PCB with an M.2 slot yourself to be less dependend on supplier software.
